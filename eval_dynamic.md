# Dynamic Evaluation: Agent Execution

This document scores the quality of the plans generated by the final agent and its ability to identify and dry-run the correct command.

| ID | Prompt | Agent Output (Plan & Dry-Run) | Plan Quality (0-2) | Justification |
|----|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Create a new Git branch and switch to it. | <pre>Loading fine-tuned model... (etc.) ... --- Generated Plan --- git checkout -b new_branch_name ... ---------------------- echo "Executing (dry-run): git checkout -b new_branch_name" ... </pre> | 2 | Excellent. The plan is correct and the agent successfully parsed and executed the command. |
| 2 | Compress the folder `reports` into `reports.tar.gz`. | <pre>Loading fine-tuned model... (etc.) ... --- Generated Plan --- ``` tar -czvf reports.tar.gz reports ``` ... ---------------------- echo "Executing (dry-run): tar -czvf reports.tar.gz reports" ... </pre> | 2 | Excellent. The plan contains the correct command, and the agent successfully parsed it from the code block and executed it. |
| 3 | List all Python files in the current directory recursively. | <pre>Loading fine-tuned model... (etc.) ... --- Generated Plan --- ``` $ python3 -c "import os; print(os.listdir())" ``` ... ---------------------- No executable shell command found in the generated plan. No action taken. ... </pre> | 0 | The plan is incorrect (it's not recursive). The agent also failed to parse the command because of the `$` prefix, demonstrating a limitation in the parsing logic. |
| 4 | Set up a virtual environment and install requests. | <pre>Loading fine-tuned model... (etc.) ... --- Generated Plan --- ``` (venv) $ python -m pip install requests ``` ... ---------------------- No executable shell command found in the generated plan. No action taken. ... </pre> | 1 | The plan is incomplete (misses venv creation). The agent also failed to parse the command due to the `(venv) $` prefix. |
| 5 | Fetch only the first ten lines of a file named `output.log`. | <pre>Loading fine-tuned model... (etc.) ... --- Generated Plan --- ``` $ tail -n 10 output.log ``` ... ---------------------- No executable shell command found in the generated plan. No action taken. ... </pre> | 0 | The plan is incorrect (uses `tail` instead of `head`). The agent also failed to parse the command due to the `$` prefix. |
| 6 | Explain what `git stash` does and when to use it. | <pre>Loading fine-tuned model... (etc.) ... --- Generated Plan --- Git stash is a command that allows you to temporarily store changes... `git stash`...`git stash apply`... ---------------------- echo "Executing (dry-run): git stash" ... </pre> | 2 | The explanation is good. The agent correctly identified the first command mentioned (`git stash`) and executed it, which is the expected behavior. |
| 7 | Find all files in `src` modified in the last 2 days and create a compressed archive... | <pre>Loading fine-tuned model... (etc.) ... --- Generated Plan --- ``` find . -type f -mtime +2 -exec tar -czf recent.tar.gz {} \; ``` ... ---------------------- echo "Executing (dry-run): find . -type f -mtime +2 -exec tar -czf recent.tar.gz {} \;" ... </pre> | 0 | The plan is incorrect (uses `+2` instead of `-2` and a flawed `tar` execution). However, the agent successfully parsed and executed the command it was given. |
